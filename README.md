This project forms a Dua Ontology and Knowledge Graph by linking two external datasets, namely Quran and Hadith Ontologies, and their vocabularies. The dataset was converted to OWL and validated with SPARQL queries.
Our main class was the Dua class, with subclasses QuranicDua and HadithDua.

The QuranicDua class contains information about the verses and mentioned prophets, and the HadithDua class contains information about the narrator of the Hadith including the narrator chain up till the root narrator, and its reference.
